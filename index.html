      <h1>Climate data specialist application</h1>
      <h3>MARKUS MANNHEIM</h3>
      <h2>One of the journalists in the climate team comes to you with a story idea of exploring whether the world is gaining ground in reducing emissions.
        The headline for the story is: "Globally we've made big promises to cut our emissions — how are we tracking?"
        It's an exploration of whether we are really reducing emissions globally or if convenient accounting is hiding the reality.</h2>
      <h4>What tools would you use to tell this story?</h4>
      <p>This is a data-driven story, and the first step in telling it would be to understand what global emissions data shows.
        However, data can also get in the way of storytelling.
        Deluging the audience with numbers, graphs and information is unlikely to engage them.</p>
      <p>At the heart of this story is a simple question: "How are we tracking?"
        This has a simple answer: global emissions are either falling or not.</p>
      <svg class="chart" id="chart1"></svg>
      <p>However, the story also aims to test whether "convenient accounting is hiding the reality".
        So it should also compare what nations <em>say</em> they are doing with the available evidence: the measured quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>I would use these tools/concepts to tell this story:</p>
      <p><span>Simplicity:</span> Numbers are abstract.
        It's unhelpful to say: "Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is at 419 parts per million."
        While the research behind the story must be thorough, the explanations and visualisations should be able to be understood within seconds.</p>
      <p>The concentration of emissions in the atmosphere should be explained as something readers understand.
        I would reinterpret this atmospheric concentration into either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a relative amount (for example, "41% above preindustrial levels"); or</li>
        <li>an estimated consequence, such as likely average global temperature rise by 2040 ("1.9°C above with preindustrial levels").</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span>Animation/transition:</span> Scrolling transitions — like Odyssey.js or Scroller.js — are a useful way to take readers on a guided tour through an abstract/data-driven story.
        But simple animations of charts can also draw a reader's focus, especially when explaining change over time.</p>
      <svg class="chart" id="chart2"></svg>
      <p><span>Historical footage/data:</span> Contrasting past public statements with related, later events can create powerful juxtapositions — especially with footage for TV or social media.
        For example, a montage/timeline of world leaders' promises since 1997 could be contrasted with actual global emissions over that time.
        The Australian story could be told with quotes from prime ministers, matched with Australia's estimated emissions.</p>      
      <h4>What visual elements might you include?</h4>
      <p>I would use as few elements as possible to tell the story powerfully.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, a simple number is enough — and is easier to understand than other visual representations.</p>
      <svg class="chart" id="chart3"></svg>
      <p>As well as the visual elements discussed above, I would also help readers explore a breakdown of Australia's emissions.
        Past questions about "convenient accounting" have centred on how changes in land use affect emissions.
        The methodology for measuring this has changed significantly over the past decade, and has created international controversies.</p>
      <p>Australia has benefited from this methodology change. It's easy to see the scale of this visually.</p>
      <svg class="chart" id="chart4"></svg>
      <p>This chart could be made interactive, allowing readers to explore each level (and sub-levels) of emission type.</p>
      <h4>Where would you go to find the data?</h4>
      <p>It's important to note that stories about climate emissions should consider not only carbon dioxide but methane and nitrous oxide, too.
        (I excluded these measurements from the visualisations on this page.)</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/gl_data.html">US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> hosts a global greenhouse gas reference network, which is the global authority on atmospheric measurements.
        This is the source relied on by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
        It publishes <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_gl.txt">atmospheric measurements monthly</a>, which we can scrape with a simple Python script.</p>
      <p>The federal government's Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water publishes <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-quarterly-update-march-2023">quarterly greenhouse gas inventories</a>.</p>
      <p>Academic projects <a href="https://globalcarbonbudgetdata.org/latest-data.html">like the Global Carbon Budget</a> aggregate climate data from many official and scientific sources, and make them available under fair-use licences.</p>
      <h4>What parts of the story could be used as an ongoing feature within climate stories?</h4>
      <p>A simple “How are we tracking?” widget, like the first on this page, could be reused as an attention-grabbing teaser to this story or other climate-related stories.
        A scraper could automatically update the widget every month.</p>
      <p>Likewise, almost all of the visualisations mentioned are not story-specific. They can be updated and republished automatically.</p>
